        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> We at LPHS deliver a  rigorous and collaborative 21st century education where students discover a lifelong love of learning. The Scholastic and Non Scholastic areas are intertwined in such a manner that they help in holistic development of a student and also facilitate geographic mobility, a boon for people on the move. The curriculum is designed and developed to support the vision and mission of the school. Through individualized education, we foster academic excellence and cultivate self-confident, creative, reflective, and analytical thinkers. The curriculum is a unique blend of emerging trends in education with tried and tested methodologies and best practices put into use.The academic year begins in April and ends in March. It comprises of two terms for the Primary and the Middle school, and three terms for the Secondary school. The school follows the CCE (continuous comprehensive assessment). The assessments are broadly classified as SA (summative assessment) and FA (Formative assessment). There are two FA's per term and the end of the term is concluded by a SA. As part of the curriculum reform, the school has student-centered and problem-based learning to stimulate active learning among students. Web-based instructions and on-line information sources are used to enhance students' active learning, while teachers act as mentors and guides in the process.
